# Meltria: A Dynamic Datasets Generating System for Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Microservices

This project build an experimental infrastructure for AIOps. (Work in Progress)

1. Generate automatically MELT (Metrics, Events, Logs, Traces) data including performance anomaly.
2. Analyze the generated data with machine learning algorithms.
